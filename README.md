# OmniTFTlib
GCC AVR hybrid port of Adafruit and UTFT libraries. Fully compatible with both Adafruit LCD drivers and UTFT fonts.

In 2017, when I first started to play with TFT, Arduino LCD shields seemed to be the most popular and affordable
option. Ironically it looks like it didn't change much since then.
Since I always prefer to develop my projects my way and to rely on some 3d party platforms the less,
I find it amusing sometimes to combine things that initially were not intended to. 
This project brings together amazing fonts from the UTFT library and rich LCD support that Adafruit libraries provide.
And I added there delayless touchpad polling as well.

WinAVR required to compile the whole thing.

Ah, and hope you find it handy.
