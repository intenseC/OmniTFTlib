# OmniTFTlib
GCC AVR hybrid port of Adafruit and UTFT libraries. Fully compatible with both Adafruit LCD drivers and UTFT fonts.

In 2017, when I first started to play with TFT, Arduino LCD shields seemed to be the most popular and affordable
option. Ironically it looks like it didn't change much since then.
And as I usually prefer to develop my projects my way and to rely on some 3d party platforms the less,
I occasionally combine things that initially were not intended to. 
This project brings together amazing fonts from the UTFT library and rich LCD support that Adafruit libraries provide.
And I added there delayless touchpad polling as well.

Precompiled binaries included. Eclipse + WinAVR required to recompile the whole thing.
