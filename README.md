# OmniTFTlib
GCC AVR hybrid port of Adafruit and UTFT libraries. Fully compatible with both Adafruit LCD drivers and UTFT fonts.

Since I always prefer to develop my projects my way and to rely on some 3d party platforms the less,
I find it amusing sometimes to combine things that initially were not intended to. 
This project brings together amazing fonts from the UTFT library and rich LCD support that Adafruit libraries provide.

Hope you find it handy.
